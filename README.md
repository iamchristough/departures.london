## FAQ

### I think something has broken?

Please report all [issues over here](http://github.com/tomspeak/departures.london/issues). If you do not have a GitHub account then email me: hello+departures@tomspeak.co.uk

### It says there are no departures at my station?

There are probably no departures. That being said, I have noticed some stations (notably Baker Street / Circle) has issues, where as others are 100% accurate (yay real world testing). I have contacted the TFL API developers for an answer - (two months later, no response).

### We don't need another tube app...

Agreed, but I did. After ~5 years of London I rarely consult the map, the use case that prompted this was: it was sometimes faster to walk to Aldgate and get the Circle line than wait for a Hammersmith & City train at Aldgate East, depending on departure times. What I needed was an _instant_ flow of information, so a simple home screen favourite on my iPhone grants me a 1-click url to <http://departures.london/hammersmith-city/aldgate-east> and I can make my decision immediately, no faff.

If your response to this is: "But CityMapper can do this", then you have missed the point and this doesn't solve a problem you have/perceive.

### The colours do not match the official ones

Whilst developing this, enduring hours of my screen glowing with the official ones, I could not stand it any longer. They are great for information boards, and when used tastefully, but for a full screen web-app, the ones I replaced them with are much easier on the eyes. Although I am always open to [suggestions](http://github.com/tomspeak/departures.london/issues).
